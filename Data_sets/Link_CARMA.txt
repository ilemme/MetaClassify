Aus PAPER: Gerlach W, Stoye J : Taxonomic classification of metagenomic shotgun sequences with CARMA3

For the evaluation of CARMA3 a synthetic and two real data sets were used.
The synthetic metagenome (Supplementary Table S1) was constructed consisting
of 25 randomly chosen bacterial genomes from the NCBI ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/).
N = 25 000 metagenomic reads were simulated using MetaSim (17) with the default
454 sequencing error model resulting in an average read length of 265 bp. 
The real data set used in Experiment 3 consists of over 600 000 unassembled
reads from a biogas plant microbial community (18). The reads were obtained 
by 454 sequencing and have an average length of 230 bp.
